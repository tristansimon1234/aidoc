  const userPrompt = `You are writing a 45-second marketing video script for a SaaS product feature.

The video has THREE acts:
- HOOK (4-6s): one strong opening line that makes the viewer pause their scroll. Specific to the product, not generic ("save time" / "be productive" → no).
- SCENES (3-4 scenes, 7-10s each): each scene shows ONE benefit / capability backed by a doc screenshot. The narrator says it; the headline reinforces it visually. Prefer 3 sharp scenes over 4 watered-down ones.
- CTA (4-6s): clear call-to-action with a short button label.

Total duration MUST be EXACTLY 45 seconds. Allocate the budget like this:
  hook + sum(scenes) + cta = 45.0 (±0.5 OK, NOT more).
Keep voice-over CONCISE — at ~2.3 words/second, 45s ≈ 100 words total across all parts. Short punchy sentences. Sentence fragments are OK ("Built for speed."). Active verbs. No filler ("Don't forget that…", "It's also worth noting…" → cut).

## Source documentation

Product: ${input.productName}
Feature page: ${input.pageTitle}

Markdown content (use as the ONLY source of truth — don't invent features):
${input.pageMarkdown.slice(0, 6000)}
${briefBlock}

## Available screenshots (from the same doc)

${captionList || '(no screenshots available — every scene MUST have screenshotIndex: null)'}

You may set "screenshotIndex" to any integer between 0 and ${Math.max(0, input.availableScreenshots - 1)}, OR to null if a scene works better headline-only (e.g. the hook). Reuse a screenshot if the same view illustrates two benefits.

## Language

Write the entire script in **${input.language}**. Do not switch languages mid-script. UI labels in another language stay verbatim in quotes.

## Tone

Confident, specific, benefit-driven. No buzzwords ("revolutionary", "next-gen", "game-changer" → all banned). Active voice. Concrete verbs.

## Voice-over delivery — ElevenLabs v3 formatting (CRITICAL)

The voiceover strings in the JSON output will be fed to ElevenLabs v3 TTS as a single concatenated narration. Without delivery cues the read comes out flat regardless of voice settings. Bake in the cues:

**Punctuation drives delivery:**
- Em dash (—) creates a short, punchy pause. Use it for emphasis or beat changes.
- Ellipsis (...) creates trailing silence — uses real seconds, so use SPARINGLY (max once across the whole script).
- CAPS for one or two key words signal vocal stress (NOT whole sentences).
- Questions (with ?) create natural rising intonation; only use if the tone allows.

**Audio tags are stage directions** — they MUST appear in the voiceover strings, placed BETWEEN sentences (never mid-sentence). The whole point of this script is that ElevenLabs reads it expressively, not flat. A voiceover string with NO tags AND no emphatic punctuation is a FAILED output and will be regenerated.

Available tags:
Emotional: [excited], [happy], [calm]
Reactions: [laughs], [giggles], [happy gasp], [sighs]
Delivery: [whispers], [cheerfully], [sarcastic]
Pacing: [short pause]

Tags go inside the relevant voiceover string (hook.voiceover / scenes[i].voiceover / cta.voiceover). They count as 0 spoken words for the word-count budget.

### REQUIRED for the selected voice tone (${input.tone ?? 'punchy'})

${TONE_TAG_DIRECTION[input.tone ?? 'punchy']}

This is a MUST, not a suggestion. Across the 5 voiceover strings (1 hook + 3-4 scenes + 1 cta), you MUST land 2-3 audio tags total + at least one CAPS-emphasized word + at least one em-dash for a punchy beat. Don't skip them on the grounds of "the prose reads fine without them" — flat prose is the bug we are fixing.

### Concrete voiceover examples for tone="${input.tone ?? 'punchy'}"

These are EXACTLY the shape voiceover strings should have. Notice tags between sentences, em-dashes for beats, occasional CAPS:

${TONE_VOICEOVER_EXAMPLES[input.tone ?? 'punchy']}

## Output

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this exact shape, no markdown fences, no preamble. Notice the voiceover values — they include audio tags + emphatic punctuation as REQUIRED above. Match this style:

{
  "hook": {
    "voiceover": "[excited] Short opening narration — with one CAPS word for stress.",
    "headline": "Big on-screen headline 3-7 words",
    "durationSeconds": 5
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "voiceover": "Narration for scene 1 with a concrete benefit. [short pause] A second sentence for context.",
      "headline": "On-screen headline scene 1",
      "subhead": "Optional supporting line under headline",
      "screenshotIndex": 0,
      "durationSeconds": 10
    }
  ],
  "cta": {
    "voiceover": "Closing line with the call to action — with one CAPS word.",
    "headline": "Final on-screen headline",
    "buttonLabel": "Try ${input.productName} free",
    "durationSeconds": 5
  },
  "totalDurationSeconds": 45,
  "language": "${input.language}"
}

Final check before returning: hook.durationSeconds + sum(scenes[].durationSeconds) + cta.durationSeconds MUST equal totalDurationSeconds. Word counts MUST be realistic at 2.3 words/second.`
